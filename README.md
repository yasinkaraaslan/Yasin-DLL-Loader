# Yasin's DLL Loader
With this mod you can create and execute .NET DLLs without need of any other mod. This can help if you don't want to make any changes in assets and just create an extension for the game. 

## Installation
Installation is just like any other mod, extract *YasinDLLLoader.zip* file and put *YasinDLLLoader* folder into 'Modules' folder in game root directory. Now you can create your own DLL files.

## Usage
The DLL files **MUST** be .NET DLLs. You need to place  in **Scripts** folder, which should be in the game root directory. If you don't have a Scripts folder, create one. More information can be found in Wiki section.
